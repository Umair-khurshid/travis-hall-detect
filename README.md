# travis-hall-detect

This repository demonstrates how to detect hallucinations in AI-generated code using Travis CI. Hallucinations, such as undefined variables, incorrect API calls, and logical inconsistencies, can cause severe issues in production systems. Automating their detection during the CI/CD process ensures better code quality and reduces debugging time.

## Features
- Static Code Analysis: Leverages flake8 to detect syntax errors, unused variables, and missing imports.
- API Call Validation: Ensures API endpoints and required parameters are correct and functional.
- Travis CI Integration: Automates hallucination detection with a pre-configured CI pipeline.
- Modular and Extensible: Add your own custom checks to adapt the pipeline for specific use cases.
